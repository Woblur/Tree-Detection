# Tree-Detection

In my own research to automate tree crown detection, and comparisons between archived and current maps and establish an accurate db to track the illegal modification and removals of the protected Ghaf tree native to the UAE.

I have noticed a great amount of these trees chopped down this year, and I've decided to do the responsible thing and leverage ML algos, CNN's, image generative AI, NFT generation, and my own flavor of NLP query fueled current geospatial composites to hold the offenders accountable for their actions.

Its no secret these are protected trees, they have metal tags to each with a ID number for government tracking and monitoring. I noticed while doing my initial research that the tree-detection topic was out of date and fairly barren considering the importance of maintaining our best C02 capture technologies available to humanity, besides the health of the entire ocean I guess.

I'm going to start combining all the relevant resources here to help anyone that has taken on an similar role in global eco-stewardship. We're fighting an exponentially increasing uphill battle, we have to utilize the most capable and bleeding edge of advancements made by technology to preserve our chances of even living a remotely stable life into the future.

Reach out if you are interested in collaborating at all on this or have anything to input on the topic and cause. I will do my best to make this as complete and useful as I can.
